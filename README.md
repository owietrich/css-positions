In a previous [article](https://github.com/owietrich/css-flow), I was saying how CSS normal flow is important and too often misunderstood. Obviously CSS positionning is also really important to know and is the key to mastering layouts.

A positioned element is an element whose computed `position` property is `relative, absolute, fixed or sticky`. 

## static

The `static` position is the default position of an element in the [normal flow](https://github.com/owietrich/css-flow). The `top, right, bottom, left and z-index` properties do not apply.

An element which is not positionned is static.

## relative

The position property `relative` allows you to adjust an element's position in the normal flow. 







For starters, we can adjust a relatively positioned element with offset properties: top, right, bottom, and left. Using the markup from our previous example, letâ€™s add an offset position to #box_2:



This keyword lays out all elements as though the element were not positioned, and then adjust the element's position, without changing layout (and thus leaving a gap for the element where it would have been had it not been positioned). The effect of position:relative on table-*-group, table-row, table-column, table-cell, and table-caption elements is undefined.


## absolute

## fixed

## float

## sticky
